Introducing Herbalism, a system for gathering and identifying herbs and making
potions out of them

# Basics

You can gather, identify, prepare and use herbs in order to make all sorts of concoctions, or to enhance your cooking recipes.

You will need basic equipment and training in Herb Lore.

## Equipment

Mandatory equipment:
 - Mortar and Pestle (for preparing herbs)
 - Vials (for making potions)
 - A Sickle (for collecting herbs)

 An herbalist kit comes with a basic mortar and pestle as well as 4 vials. It costs 5gp. A sickle costs another 1gp. You would likely find them all at your local general goods store.

 Higher-Quality equipment will give you an edge, mainly two items:
  - Artisan-quality mortar and pestle: bonus on making potions 
    - Cost: 30gp (city), 40gp (town), 50gp (village)
  - Golden sickle: bonus on preparing herbs
    - Cost: 40gp (city), 55gp (town), 70gp (village)


## Training

In addition, you would need to find an alchemist to train your in Herb Lore. Without Herb Lore you may attempt to manipulate herbs, but you will suffer a penalty because of the lack of specialized knowledge. Training is available for each of the steps of herbalism: searching, identifying, preparing and contacting.

Training Costs:
 - Searching Herbs 101: 5gp and 2 hours of downtime
 - Identifying Herbs 101: 10gp and 4 hours of downtime
 - Preparing Herbs 101: 10gp and 3 hours of downtime
 - Concocting Herbs 101: 15gp and 4 hours of downtime

 The costs are halved for those proficient in Nature, as you can basically build off your existing knowledge.

# Herb Activities

The base roll for all herbalism activities is either Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Nature). Modifiers to the DC check are applied depending the specific herbalism activity you are doing.

## Herb Search

### Searching for Random Herbs

Roll: Wisdom (Nature) 

Looking for useful herbs in the wild is not simply a matter of marching into the
nearest patch of woodland and pulling up a bunch of weird-looking plants. One
must consider the seasons of the year, the terrain they are searching in, the
weather at the time, and even how far they are from the nearest large
settlement. DC Modifiers for these variables are given below:

**Hero Skill Modifier:**

| Hero Skill                            | Modifier |
| --------------------------------------|----------|
| Missing Herb Lore Skill               | +5       |

**Season Modifier:**

| Season   | Modifier |
| -------- | -------- |
| Spring   | -2       |
| Summer   | -1       |
| Autumn   | +1       |
| Winter   | +2       |

**Terrain Modifier:**

| Terrain                        | Modifier |
| -------------------------------| -------- |
| Forest or Jungle               | -2       |
| Hills, Marsh, or River-bank    | -1       |
| Mountains or Plains            | +1       |
| Caves, Dungeons, or Ruins      | +2       |
| Deserts or Wilderness          | +3       |

**Weather Modifier:**

| Weather          | Modifier |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Snowing          | +3       |
| Raining          | +1       |
| Hot or Heat-wave | +1       |

**Location Modifier:**

| Location                                     | Modifier |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------  |
| Within 20 miles of a large town or city:     | +1       | 

### Searching for specific herbs

Apply the above modifiers plus these ones:

| Specificity   | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Specific Herb |  +1      |

| Rarity        | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Common        |  -1      |
| Uncommon      |  +1      |
| Rare          |  +2      |
| Very Rare     |  +3      |

You may only look for herbs once per day. Failure means you don't find any, and
Success means you find some appropriate to the location you are searching in. 

## Identifying Herbs

Roll: Intelligence (Nature) 

Faerun is a wide and varied place with many different cultures, and all with
specific herbs and fungi unique to their area. As such, unless a Hero has spent
a lifetime studying botany, it is unlikely they will know every plant they see,
and will need to try and identify new herbs based on scraps of lore or
conversations with herbalists. This is modified by the availability of the herb,
as rarer herbs are more difficult to identify than common ones by virtue of
their scarcity, and whether the Hero has any experience in the terrain that the
herb originally comes from 


| Identifiying Situation                   | Modifier |
|------------------------------------------|----------|
| Hero doesn't have Identifiying Herb Lore | +5       |
| Common                                   | -1       |
| Uncommon                                 | +1       |
| Rare                                     | +2       |
| Very Rare                                | +3       |

Heroes may only try to identify a new herb once a day. Failure means they cannot
identify it, and will not be able to do so in the future, unless they consult
with a local herbalist or other source of lore. If they do this, may they try
again the next day to identify it (unless the herbalist has already identified
it for them already, for a fee of course). Success means that they have
identified what the herb is, though they do not necessarily know its properties.

Depending on the rarity of the herb, another roll might be required to identify
the herb's specific properties. Do another roll with the same modifiers. Success
means knowing exactly what the plant does. Failure means the Hero cannot
identify the herbâ€™s properties unless they consult with another source of lore.

## Preparing Herbs

Roll: Wisdom (Nature) 

Picking herbs is not as easy as simply grabbing the first strange plant you see
in the woods. Herbs need to be carefully picked, prepared, and stored if their
special properties are to be maintained. Availability is an issue, because
Heroes will have less experience handling very rare herbs, as is familiarity
with the terrain the herb is found in, and the weather at the time. A delicate
herb plucked in the middle of a snow-storm is less-likely to retain its
properties in the adverse conditions!


| Preparing Situation Modifier               | Modifier |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Hero does not have Preparing Herb Lore     | +5       |
| Availability: Common                       | -1       |
| Availability: Uncommon                     | +1       |
| Availability: Rare                         | +2       |
| Availability: Very Rare                    | +3       |
| Herbs were collected with a Golden Sickle  | -1       |
| Hero has relevant Terrain Lore             | -1       |
| Hero does not have relevant Terrain Lore   | +1       |
| Weather: Snowing                           | +3       |
| Weather: Raining                           | +1       |
| Weather: Hot or Heat-wave                  | +1       |


Heroes may only try to prepare herbs once for each herb they have
found. Thus, if they have found four Fishbait Flowers growing by a pond, they
may make four Herb Lore rolls to see how many of the Flowers they successfully
pick. Failure means the herb has been damaged during the process and lost its
properties. Success means that they have carefully picked the herb and it is
ready for immediate use, or to be stored away and used in a future concoction.

Depeding on rarity, a check might not be needed. 

## Concocting Herbal Infusions

Roll: Wisdom (Nature) 

The main purpose of collecting herbs, other than using them for their individual
properties, is to create various infusions and potions by mixing the herbs
together. While this does not require elaborate workshops or laboratories, it
still needs some equipment and the modifiers given below are for whether the
Hero has the equipment (positive modifier), or not (negative modifier). In
addition, if all the herbs were collected using a Golden Sickle, this will then
go some way to ensuring the effectiveness of the potion. Lastly, the presence of
non-herbs makes things trickier (the Hero is after all testing their Herb Lore
Special Skill), while time can have either a negative or positive impact on the
process depending on whether the concoction is rushed or not.

| Concocting Situation Modifier               | Modifier |
| --------------------------------------------|----------|
| Hero does not have Concocting Herb Lore     | +5       |
| Equipment: Artisan-Quality Mortar           | -1       |
| Equipment: Fire                             | +1/-1    |
| Equipment: Water and oil                    | +1/-1    |
| Herbs were collected using Golden Sickle    | -1       |
| Ingredients: All herbs                      | -1       |
| Ingredients: Some non-herbs                 | +1       |
| Time: 2h spent                              | -1       |
| Time: 4h spent                              | +1       |

Heroes may only test their Herb Lore Special Skill once per day when concocting
a herbal potion or infusion. A failure means the potion is ineffective though
they may try again the next day with the same ingredients. A roll of 1 means
they have failed and the ingredients are either destroyed or rendered inert and
useless. Success means they have created one dose of the potion they were
attempting to concoct, and its properties are as described for the relevant
herbal entries.
