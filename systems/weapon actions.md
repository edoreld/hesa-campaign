# Weapon Actions from Larian's Baldur's Gate 3

## The Core Rules

Weapon Actions are special Actions tied to a weapon you are wielding. Every weapon has at least 1 weapon Action, and in order to use the Weapon Action, you must have the appropriate weapon Proficiency. Some Actions take a Bonus Action, while others replace an attack you make. A weapon Action must be made with the weapon tied to it and cannot be made as part of casting a spell or another Weapon Action. Additionally, the Attack being replaced must have been made as part of taking an Action or Bonus Action on your part. For instance, you cannot take a Weapon Action as a Reaction, even if your Battle Master fighter friend lets you make an attack as a Reaction. At the same time, if you are engaged in Two-weapon fighting with a Sickle and a Dagger, only your dagger can use the Piercing Strike Action.

Unlike BG3, you may use Weapon Actions of either of the weapons you are wielding while engaged in Two-Weapon Fighting.

Weapons all have Wear, and each Weapon Action consumes Wear from the equipped weapon. Wear is discussed more in the Weapon Wear section below.

## Weapon Wear

Generally speaking, each Weapon Action consumes 1 Wear from the equipped weapon, and you cannot perform a Weapon Action if the weapon's wear is at 0. Each weapon also has a maximum amount of wear equal to the number of Weapon Actions it has access to. For instance, the Greatsword has 3 Weapon Actions, Pommel Strike, Lacerate, and Cleave. Greatswords have 3 Wear.

Wear is recovered by performing simple maintenance on a weapon over a Short or Long Rest. You can perform this maintenance on a number of weapons equal to your Proficiency Bonus each Rest.

Additionally, the Mending Spell can restore Wear to a weapon, though each weapon can only be restored this way once per Long Rest.

## Conditions
This section will cover Conditions that the various Weapon Actions can inflict. This is at the start of the document so that when the Conditions come up in **Bold and Italics** in the descriptions of the Weapon Actions you'll know what they do.

**Off Balance**
The next attack against this creature is made with advantage.

**Weakened**
The creature has disadvantage on their next attack roll.

**Dazed**
The affected creature may only take an Action, a Bonus Action, or use their movement. They cannot take Reactions.

**Bleeding**
The creature suffers 1 additional die of Slashing damage until it regains any amount of Hit points or suffers Slashing damage.

**Gaping Wound**
The creature suffers 1 additional die of Piercing damage until it regains any amount of hit points or suffers Piercing damage.

**Concussed**
The creature suffers 1 additional die of Bludgeoning damage until it regains any amount of hit points or suffers Bludgeoning damage.

Conditions don't stack
