# House Rules

## Sources
 - Eberron stuff is banned

## Combat
 - Shove (to push away) is a bonus action
 - Flanking: when a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemyâ€™s space, they are said to be flanking the enemy. When flanking, each of the allies gains +2 on melee attack rolls against that enemy. 

 ## Roleplaying
 - Inspiration will given for players who play according to their traits, bonds, flaws and ideals. 
    * If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check to gain advantage on that roll.
    * You can only have one inspiration at a time. 
 - You can use your Strength modifier instead of your Charisma modifier when making Intimidation checks
