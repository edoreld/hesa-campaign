Version: 0.0.6 (BETA)

Introducing a character-to-character relationship system. As your bond with other players strengthens, so does your ability to fight with them, work with them, etc. 

## Relationship Levels

Here are the currently available relationship levels. 

### Relationship Levels

#### Acquaintance

 - At this level, characters are getting to know each other but haven't formed a deep bond yet.

#### Friendship

Characters have become good friends and can rely on each other in times of need.

  - Once per short rest, and when standing next to each other, if an enemy makes makes an attack against either one of you, the non-attacked player can use their reaction to provide the attacked player with a bonus of +1 to AC for that one attack. 

Requirements: Acquaintance

#### Close Friendship

The bond has deepened to the point where characters actively look out for each other's well-being.    

 - Whenever you both are facing an enemy that you both can reach with your weapon in melee range, and you are not currently flanking, you may add +1 to your attack roll against that target. 
 - Whenever one of you makes a ranged attack or a ranged spell attack roll against a target that your friend is facing in melee combat, you get a +1 to your attack roll against that target
  - Friendship's boons

Requirements: Friendship

#### Trusted Ally

These characters trust each other implicitly and can share their intentions effortlessly.

 - You can help your ally with an ability check for which you have no proficiency, giving the roll a +2 bonus
 - Close Friendship's boons
 
 Requirements: Close Friendship

#### Love Interest

Characters have developed a romantic connection that fuels their strength in times of crisis.

- Jealously: characters have a +1 to any saving throw made against being charmed by creatures who are not their love interest.
- Characters proficients in Medicine have advantage on Wisdom checks made to stabilize the other character. If they are not proficient in medicine, they get a +2 to the roll.
- Trusted Ally's boons

Requirements: Trusted Ally

#### Mentorship

One character has taken on the role of a mentor, guiding and teaching the other.    

 - The mentor can teach the other player a skill they are proficient with, under some conditions. See "Learning New Proficiencies" below
 - Close Friendship's Boons

Requirements: Close Friendship or Higher

## Learning New Proficiencies

In order to learn a new skill, tool or weapon, you must train at least 4 hours a day with your mentor. After this time training, you can attempt a Training check in order to incerease your understanding. 

### Limited by intelligence

You may only learn a number of proficiencies equal to double your intelligence modifier (minimum 1)

### Training a proficiency

Pick something you want to learn - a tool, weapon, language or skill - and then determine the appropriate ability for that proficiency. 

```markdown
| New Proficiency | Ability Required                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Language        | Intelligence                         |
| Skill           | Varies                               |
| Tool            | Varies                               |
| Weapon          | Strength or Dexterity (if finesse)   |
```


Once you have selected what you wish to train, and have chosen the proper ability score, you can then spend four hours and at the end of practice, you can then roll a d20. This is your Training Check and if you roll the maximum amount, you have successfully made progress on training your new proficiency. You can now roll a d12 instead of a d20 when you make your next Training Check.

The Training Check die continues to decrease in size on every result of a maximum amount. This means that your Training Check die will begin as a d20, and then slowly get smaller as you increase your own understanding and make progress on your training. It goes from a d20 to a d12, d10, d8, d6, and last a d4.

Once you roll a 4 on a d4, you mark a Training Success and you must gain a number of Training Successes equal 4. Once you gain a number of required Training Successes, you are considered proficient.

You can only make a Training Check once per day. If you practice for an additional 4 hours a day, for a total of 8 hours, on a result of a 19 or 20 on the die, you can make progress and move on to the next die. Spending additional time training has no additional effect on a d4.

#### Relevant Abilities

Your relevant ability modifier allows you to automatically succeed and make progress on your Training Check a number of times equal to the ability modifier, up to a maximum of five times. This means that your die size automatically decreases a number of times equal to your modifier. See the chart below.

|Ability Modifier|Your Starting Die Size|
|---|---|
|+0|d20|
|+1|d12|
|+2|d10|
|+3|d8|
|+4|d6|
|+5|d4|

If you are a 2nd level Cleric with a +3 bonus to Wisdom and you wish to learn the Medicine skill, you would start out with a d8 for your Training Check. At the end of 4 hours where you practiced and studied medicine, anatomy, and health - you would then roll a d8. On a roll of 8, you would then move on to a d6 for the check. You would repeat this Training Check until you gained 2 successes on a d4 die.

#### Training Costs

Certain proficiencies will require a cost in gold to pay for supplies and materials. On average, the cost is 2gp per day, but it may be lower or higher depending of what is being trained.
