Events
Milijov confesses to the theft of the bones. Henrik, the local coffinmaker, hired Milivoj to steal the bones. Milivoj agreed because he needed some money to hire hunters to find some missing children. 

The adventurers head to the coffinmaker but on the way get intercepted by a man. The man invites them to his employer's house. There, they meet Lady Fiona, who shares her distaste of the current Vallaki burgomaster. The adventurers agree to look into that.

Then they head to the shop of Blinsky - the famous toymaker - and find a doll strangely shaped like Serah who has been commissioned by some person. Serah commissions a bunch of dolls there.

Then, they head to the coffin maker shop. Henrik answers from behind a locked door, but is very uncooperative. Skarr muscles his way in, breaking the lock on the door, and confronts the man, who admits that the bones are on the 2nd floor. 

After some back and forth, the adventurers head upstairs and find a bunch of crates. Upon opening one, several vampire spawn sprout from all the crates, and they run away from the house, one of them carrying a sack. 
A crazy chase ensues across town. In the backdrop of women and children screaming as vampires sink their fangs into them, the adventurers keep their objective in mind and chase the one with the sack. After some chase, much yelling, and much blood, the adventurers retrieve the sack and find the bones within.

It's at that point that the adventurers see Strahd himself -riding on a nightmarish horse - descend from the sky headed for the party. Serah then hurries on celestial wings to the church and somehow manages to make it in time and deliver the bones to the right place before Strahd can do anything.

Strahd seems pissed and make some passive aggressive comments at Serah before flying off.

The adventurers then chase and finish off the rest of the vampire spawn with the help of the city guard. Then, Serah hears someone from behind shouting at her "Sister!?"...
