Events

The session starts at breakfast time with Arabelle and Arrigal. Arabelle offers to reveal some of Sereh's past but she prefers to be kept in the dark.

They then go to the reformation center and see a flash from the top of the burgomaster's house. Then the bard Rictavio approaches them and warns them about their course of action and invites them to join him later.

Then, they witness the trial of Henrik at the Reformation Center and they talk to a sympathetic guard outside. They persuade him to help them in infiltrating the center. While waiting for night time, they sneak into the Burgomaster's house to investigate the flash. 

They meet a young man in the attic by the name of Victor who is accompanied by skeletal cats and have a little chat.

Then, they head back to the reformation center and successfully infiltrate it and make their way into the basement. There, they free a bunch of prisoners and escape through a tunnel someone had dug in one of the prisons. 
They take the prisoners back to the church. One of them had been taken from Lady Fiona's house, so they take her back there. Lady Fiona is grateful and offers them a place to sleep, but they say goodbye and go back to the inn. A meow is hard as they leave the house.

The meet Rictavio and have a talk about the political situation in Vallaki. Then, they go to sleep and see how Lancelot is having a hard time. Then they spend some thinking about how some of them have had nightmares and they start having suspicions on something afoul taking place. They make some guesses on what the problem is and decide on a course of action.
In the morning they go talk to the liberated prisoners in the church, and one of them recommends they talk to the leatherwork as someone who can organize a better form of government. The leatherwork suggests that Lady Fiona will probably make a power play and basically replace the Baron as people trust her. He shares what he knows about her, and suggests the player to do some research. 

The adventurers have one more day until the festival of the blazing sun... will they succeed in changing Vallaki's government?
