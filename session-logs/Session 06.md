## Events

The party generously sacrifices a lot of gold in order to have their barbarian friend Skarr resurrected by Sister Garaele. After some talk, they head out to the mayor's house, where they deliver Glasstaff/Iarno and find out a bunch of info about the Black Spider, such that he's a dark elf, and that he's searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. 

Then they go back to the Redbrand hideout. They find a quirky eye monster who rambles a lot, and some treasure at the bottom of a crevasse. Then, they literally kick open a door and knock 2 bugbears unconscious and charm the third one. This one they interrogate into revealing the precise location of Cragmaw Castle.

They bring 2 of the bugbears (the fate of the the 3rd unknown) to the townmaster's hall and then kill them. Later, they visit the retired adventurer at the orchard and he tells them of some undead at Old Owl's Well and if they can check it out.

Finally, the party takes a long rest and heads out northwest to cragmaw castle. Night arrives before reaching there, and they take camp. During the first watch, Skarr and Serah hear some noises. Serah goes investigate and sees a bunch of wolves. She quickly goes back to the party and cries 'Wolves!"
