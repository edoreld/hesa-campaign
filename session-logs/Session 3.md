 ## Events

 - Year: 1491 DR

After spending a night camping/sleeping at the inn, the party wakes up to find an herbalist riding a wagon into a town. They hire her services and some of the party learn to gather useful herbs for alchemy, while Skarr performs a masterful hunt of a doe.

Then, the party comes back to town where they are confronted by a band of red-cloaked bandits. A fight ensues and 3 of the bandits die. The party captures and interrogates one of them and find information about their leader who's called Glasstaff, and about the Black Spider ordering the bandits to threaten villagers. The captured bandit also says to be beware of the "eye monster" and says the kidnapped family is in their hideout under Tresendar Manor.

Seraphalia goes looks for Sildar and brings him back to the bandit, where he reveals an additional piece of info that the leader is in the northwest part of the hideout. Then, Dax asks Sildar for a reward for clearing the hideout, and Sildar points him to the Miner's Exchange. There, they meet with Halia, the boss of the place. Then, they ask if she offers a reward for clearing the Redbrand hideout. 

She asks for more information of what the party find out, and Dax says something like "there doesn't seem to be a reward here", so Halia bids them goodbye and then Dax lets the bandit go unbeknownst to the rest of the party. 

Then, they all meet up at the shrine where they then accompany Sister Garaele to the ruined town. They talk to the banshee and give her the necklace, and she answers the question about the book, which safisties the Sister. As a reward, they receive 3 healing potions.

Then, they continue east through the Triboar Trail and search for the orc camp. After some time they find it. Darion charms an orc guard and gathers some info about their numbers. Then, the party plans their move
