The party continue their exploration of Wave Echo Cave. They come across a room filled to the brim with skeletons and promptly defeat them. After the fight, they find an office with a locked chest which they load up in their bags since they don't seem to have a way to open it. Later, they explore some passages and Dax gets ambushed by a mustard looking jelly creature and a fight ensues.

They continue after the fight and find a room filled with water with a skeleton at the bottom of the water with a couple of nice rings and a wand. After that, they head to a carved door to the northwest and inside find the Black Spider. After some tense conversation a fight ensues, and the party gets pretty beaten up but more or less manage to have the upper hand. The Black Spider then casts a spell that brings the ceiling down, and the room gets covered in dust and debris. After people recover from that, they find the Black Spider gone, and the room slowly starts filling with a mysterious mist.

They explore a bit more around and a find dwarf which is probably Gundren's brother. They then go back to the source of the mist and find a secret passage behind a statue. They follow it and fall unconscious.

Later, they wake up in a forest clearing, surrounded by mists and dead looking trees. They follow where the mist appears thinnest and come across a manor. Two kids are standing sadly outside the manor and tell the party that there's a monster inside and if they can oh so kindly check on their baby brother that's on the third floor. 
The party heroically decide to help the kids, and head inside the house. There, they find some weird stuff: a dining room with noises of people talking but no one being inside when they enter; a room with a piano that when Darion plays a sheet of music some ghosts appear and a scrapping noise is heard; a library with a secret room containing books detailing fiend summoning rituals as well as a chest filled with some deeds and wills.

On top of that, they find the good boy Lancelot dog who's hiding under the piano and who tells Skarr about a sad mistress. The explorations will be continued in the next session..,
