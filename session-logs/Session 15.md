Groot vomits out Grommash and his friends, Grommash explain Groot / The Luggage's backstory as well as his own backstory of being programmed by a wizard to run the cave dungeon, then they run off into the sunset.

The party then travels into Phandalin, buys a goddamn map, and then head to Old Owl's Well where they meet a wizard of Thay who's casually keeping a few zombies as servants. Having found out what was going on they head back to town and pick up Gundren and make their way to Wave Echo Cave. There they fight a few blood-enjoying bats, some undead creatures who can't hit for shit, and a fun flaming skull that almost single- handedly killed Serah.

They find the source of the water pounding, then meet a friendly spectator guarding some magical weapons and a mean ghostly creature that wants the spectator killed. They lie to the ghostly creature that they will kill the spectator, then they get out of there.
