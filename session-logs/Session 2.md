The goblin that had suddenly appeared brought with him other goblins, a wolf and a bugbear. Klarga had arrived! And oh boy, she was not happy. A fight ensues, and though things look dire at first, the party is able to kill all of their enemies. All, that is, except a small goblin that slips between their fingers. 

The party follows the goblin into the western room of the hideout where they meet a tall goblin who is holding a very battered-looking Sildar Hallwinter. They talk to the goblin and share the news of Klarga's demise. The goblin seems impressed but he won't give up the human unless he gets some gold. Darion uses his charm (his magical one) to befriend the goblin and persuade him to give up the human without a reward.

It seems like the situation is resolved, but Horvir has an itchy finger ready to lay an arrow on the goblins, and so he shoots. The adventurers and the goblins shoot back and forth, with some wounds inflicted from both sides. Then, Dax yells to the goblin leader that the party is willing to let them go if they stop fighting. So persuasive is his tone, and seeing as his goblin underlings are quickly dying, the leader and the rest of the goblins leave the cave.

The party then loots the cave and finds some lovely stuff, including a cooking book and a duck statuette. Oh yes, and some supplies belonging to the **Lionshields** merchant company. They then talk to Sildar and get some useful information out of him. They spend the night in the cave and the next morning they load up the wagon with all the supplies and head to Phalandin.

At Phalandin they:

 - Deliver the supplies to Barthen's Provisions 
 - Deliver the supplies to the Lionshield trading post
 - Get told by Sildar that he will get a gold reward for them
 - Talk to the townmaster who wants someone to deal with the orcs in Triboar Trail
 - Talk to Sister Garaele in the Shrine of Tymora who wants them to be an intermediary to talk to a banshee
 - Learn a few things from talking to locals in the inn
