Events

The adventurers tend the wounded for a few hours. Then, Serah gets approached by Izek, captain of the guard, who calls her sister and says her real name is Katerina. 

Izek takes them to the Burgomaster's Mansion, where they meet Vargas Vallakovich, who seems grateful of their help. Then, they visit Izek's room, which is filled to the brim with plushies of Serah in different ages. Shocked, she covers herself in a bunch of plushies and asks about her parents. 

Meanwhile, Skarr goes exploring around the house and takes a dip in a bathtub. Upon finding him, Serah goes to take him out but instead slips on some water and falls in with him. Hilarious! 

They ask to Izek if he wants to come along with them, and he happily agrees as he doesn't want to be separated from his sister.

After that, they head to the inn, where people look sad and angry. They talk to some people about the current ambience in Vallaki, then order some drinks and go to sleep in a bed offered by the innkeeper.

In the morning, they meet up with Izek - who's quit his job - and head to Lake Zarovich to investigate rumors of a missing fisherman. There, they find a man on a boat who has a wiggling sack. 

As the man is about to throw the sack in the water, Serah and Skarr hurry up and swim and fly respectively as the sack hits the water. Skarr then dives in the water, retrieves the sack and heads to the shore 
At the shore, he opens the sack to find Arabelle, a Vistani girl who they were supposed to buy a gift for. She says that she had been kidnapped by Bluto, the fisherman, and encourages the adventurers to kill Bluto - which they did the axe way.

Then, they bring Arabelle to the Vistani camp. There, they are greeted by heroes by Luvash, Arabelle's father, and Arrigal, her uncle, as well as the other Vistani. Izek has some romantic times with a couple of Vistani girls while Serah gets cockblocked by Skarr. They go to sleep in wagons and Skarr has horrible nightmares of crying children which make him more tired than he already was.

Before leaving, they get some more hooks, like a guy who's been getting dreams of his dead sister. And Luvash tells them if they pass by the Winery, to check on a shipment of wine that hasn't arrived
