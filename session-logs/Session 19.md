## Events

The adventurers meet an old lady that sells them some pies. Then, they meet a Vistani guy who asks them to buy a gift to his niece.

Later, they reach the gates of Vallaki. They get controlled by some guards and eventually make their way in. At the town square they see people in stocks and Skarr almost tries to free them, but Serah convinces to give it up.

At the church of St. Andral, they find that the bones that protect the church are missing. Their investigations lead them to the nearby orphanage. There, they discover there's a demon who's wreaking havoc and thanks to a timely intervention from Father Lucian they manage to contain it.
