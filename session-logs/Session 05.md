## Events

 - Year: 1491 DR

The party continues their exploration of the Redbrand hideout. Serah finds a pit trap and [[Dax]] builds an ice bridge over it, totally bypassing it. Then, they find a old crypt with sarcophagi with the carvings of some noble people and some skeletons standing by. They throw the skeletons into the pit and they enter the adjoining room, finding some slave pens where some captives are being held.  

They find Mirna Dendrar along with her teenage children, Nars and Nilsa. Then, they take them back to town, with Mirna telling the party about a potential reward if they make their way to Thundertree and find a necklace in her family's old alchemy shop.

They continue dungeoneering, eventually finding some secrets doors that lead to a wizard's bedchamber. They confront the wizard and try to arrest him, but as Skarr is pushing his way past Seraphalia and [[Dax]] to (probably) punch some sense into him, the wizard uses the distraction to escape and yell for help. As the party beats him up, he seems to surrender, but his goons soon come and he escapees again. Battle ensues!

A rough fight ensues in which Seraphalia sleeps the wizard and one of the bandits inflicts a fatal blow on Skarr. [[Dax]] casts a spell to preserve the barbarian's body, and then the party loot for a bit before rushing to the temple in Phandalin, where they ask Garaele to resurrect Skarr...
