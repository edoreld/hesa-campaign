Session Log #23
10th-12th Oct 1491 DR

Featuring
Quinn playing as the cleric, Serah Heyman 

The adventurers get more info on the winery, then make their way into the vineyards. They notice dozens of blights chasing them and rush towards the door of the building. They somehow manage to make it in time into the building and barricade the doors behind them. Then, they confront one of the forest folk inside and get into a fight. Defeating dozens of blights and the forest folk, they further investigate the winery, finding more forest folk and stronger versions of the blight they have known before. They manage to defeat them and eventually find a forest folk that has an evil looking staff from which new blights are sprouting.

The forest woman gets away and they chase her into the basement, where they fall into a trap of fog cloud and creeping vines that impede their movement. They brute force their way through and manage to defeat everyone. Then, they go to talk to the owners to tell them the mission is complete. The owners come back and offer the party a reward but Serah rejects it. Then, he tells them that the vineyards were powered by magical gems which have been stolen, and asks them if they can check for the gems in Yesterhill and Berez. He also gives them some information on the Ladies and their Fanes, one of which is located at the top of Yesterhill.
