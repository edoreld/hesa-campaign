# Events

The party finishes the battle, killing King Grol - a mighty bugbear - and rescuing Gundren Rockseeker. In the same room, they find the map of Wave Echo Cave. Then, they loot the castle and find some nice items. Gundren asks them to escort him back to Phandalin and help him with finding his brothers, to which the party agrees.

Then, the party takes a long rest and during Horvir and Seraphalia's watch they hear some goblin voices. They send Darion disguised as King Grol to shoo them away, which he does. Then, they go back and finish their long rest. In the morning, they make their way to Phandalin, with the plan to pass by Thundertree Ruins on the way
