Events
Seraphalia get some beeping from her wand on the way, and the party decides to check it out. On the way, they meet a hunter called Tormar Deepwods, who tells them about some monster lurking in the woods. When the party further investigates, they find a duck standing on a stone. The party all start casting ritual spells, and the goose starts approaching them, with more geese coming out of the water. Darion decides to attack the goose, casting dissonant whispers at it and starting a fight, where the goose is surrounded by mirror images. The party defeats the goose, but the images get absorbed by the main goose and it grows into a larger size. At the same time, a muddy creature appears and covers the party with lights, and then spends the rest of his time making purple flowers grow. 

The party fight the goose and the mud creature until Skarr has the idea to put his fist inside the goose's stomach on the hunch that it had some purple shard inside it like with the wolves, and indeed he's able to pull the shard out, at which point the goose reverts back to normal. Skarr then gives the moon fragment to Serah, and the two moon fragments the party had fuse together.

Dax then covers the muddy creature in water, revealing a white stag. The stag approaches and communicates mentally with Seraphalia, and then she has a vision of a ruined temple. The party heads there and Seraphalia performs a ritual to send the fused moon fragments back to where they come from. 
The party investigates the temple, finding some coins with the face of Sel√ªne and some silver-tipped arrows. They decide to leave everything there untouched.

After leaving the temple, they head for Thundertree Ruins along with the goose that they seem to have adopted. After camping, they enter the ruined city and investigate a few ruined buildings, fighting some twig blights and some shadows along the way.
