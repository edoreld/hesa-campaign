The party investigate a bunch of stuff during the day. They talked to Lady Fiona, to Rictavio, to the Wachter Brothers, to Father Lucian, trying to get as much info as possible. They also meet Fiona's daughter Stella, who seems to think she's a cat and has been locked in a room in the Wachter house. It seems as if she was fine before she got engaged to Viktor Vallakovich. 

At night, they sneaked into Fiona's house, discovering a secret basement with some undead - who they fight - and a pentagram inscribed on the floor. They also find some men and women who were sleeping in cots. When the men and women wake, they attack the party and get taken down quite quickly.

In the morning, the party and everyone else gets shoved the to the festival with people looking unhappy. There's a giant wicker ball brought to the town square and the burgomaster tries to set it on fire, but the heavy rains douses his torch and he can't. A man laughs and the burgomaster orders him arrested.

Is is at that point that shit hits the fan, as the crowd erupts in anger and attacks the burgomaster. People die, guards die, the burgomaster and wife get lynched and fires start consuming the town. Meanwhile, Lady Fiona is making a speech to some of her followers. 

Skarr gets next to Lady Fiona and tries to talk to her followers, but they are not really in a listening mood and aren't receptive to his words. Then, he tries grappling Lady Fiona and it ends up with the villagers beating him up and Lady Fiona escaping. 

In the meanwhile, Serah has remembered Stella and flies all the way to Lady Fiona's house to rescue her. She does this just in time before the flames consume the house.  Then she takes Stella north of the town 

Serah makes her way into town and rescues Skarr, who's unconscious on the ground after suffering a major beating. She takes Stella and Skarr to the church, where hundreds of people gather. She tries to get them to go to the nearby Vistani camp though they don't seem very receptive. 

She then heads herself to the Vistani camp where she asks Arabelle if she can complete her fortune and learns some juicy lore about her background

Afterwards, they leave Vallaki for Krezk. They see a skeletal rider riding a skeletal horse and let them pass. Afterwards, they pass by a tower on a lake. Eventually, they reach the gates of Krezk, but they are turned away by a boss-like figure. He says the only way they could come in is if they do them a favor by bringing them some wine.

They then head to the winery and meet the owners of the place. The owners ask for their help...
