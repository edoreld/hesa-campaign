Featuring
Quinn playing as the cleric, Serah Heyman 
Sara, playing as Agnes Splinter

The party secure an ally in the person of Ezmerelda, the Vistani woman. She tells them that they can count on her support when they will need it.

Then, they meet Clovin a two-headed mongrel playing a disturbing song on his string instrument. Accompanying him is Agnes, a short, peculiar woman. She joins the party after a brief conversation.

Agnes and Serah confront the Abbot about the mongrels in the Abbey, and seem willing to attack him until he reveals his true form, that of a powerful deva. The party reconsider their plan and travel back to town, not without on the way stopping for a minute to talk to an old woman and take a view of the town.

They go back to the burgomaster's house and have dinner with Anna, Dmitri and Ilya, their recently resurrected son who's eating healthily. In the morning, they visit the pool with the Shrine of the White sun. There, Ireena recognizes the face of Sergei - a man Ireena says she was supposed to marry a long time ago - in the water. Sergei beckons her but Serah stops Ireena from getting closer. A lightning strikes the pool at the shrine and Strahd's voice booms "She is mine!". The gazebo in the shrine is destroyed and they find a book in its ruins with some background info about Strahd.

Later, the adventurers take an interest in Krezk's sheep problem. They investigate and find Luca, the simpleminded sheep herder, who doesn't really know what's going on. During their investigation a crowd starts forming, eventually talking themselves into anger and Anna points at Luca as the possible person at fault for the sheep missing. Serah calms her down though, and suddenly a scream is heard 
The adventurers head to the source of the scream to see the old woman they met earlier. She's being attacked by a monster with the features of Ilya. The party put the monster down after a fight, and Anna weeps over its corpse. Dmitri seems catatonic. The villagers worriedly talk out loud about how they are gonna resolve the food situation, and one of them suggests checking if the Fidatov can share some food. 

The party head to the Fidatov and come upon a party with string music. There, they mingle with the guests, hear some rumors and talk to the lady of the house, who gives them a tour. She denies help to the party but bid them to stay for the night.
