# Events

The party continues exploring the ruins of Thundertree, fighting more twig blights, more shadows, and some dusty zombies. 

They eventually come across a druid called Reidoth, who informs of them of the local threats and of the presence of a young green dragon. The party decides to deal with the dragon.

Then they loot some ruined houses and eventually come across a house inhabited by a group of funkily-dressed humans.

They talk their way into the house, and meet a guy called Favric. Favric tells them he's part of an organization that tries to talk and negotiate deals with dragons around Faer√ªn. Favric asks the party if they can help him negotiate with the local green dragon, and the party says they need to talk about it, so they head outside and get attacked by some twig blights. After the fight, Skarr says how he suspects Favric, and they decide to capture and interrogate him instead. 

The party tries to make their way back into the house, but the cultists have grown suspicious as the party took some time getting back to them, so they only let Darion in. Darion tries to extract some info from Favric, and it's about to cast suggestion, but Skarr grows suspicious and breaks down the door into the house. Some heated discussion ensues, followed by a short fight where the party easily dispatches the guys inside.

The party captures the leader and two cultists, and interrogate them about their personal life, beat them up a bit and decide to releaes them. As for the leader, they interrogate him, but don't get any new info except for the name of the organisation which is the Cult of the Dragon. They decide to take Favric with them.

They end up going to some barracks-looking building where they fight some shadows and some zombies. Then, they take a short rest. Afterwards, they head up the hill to meet the dragon, but on the way, Serah's book start flying away. When chasing after it, Serah gets punched in the gut, and a fight ensues with an invisible attacker. The party takes heavy damage but they eventually are victorious, and the invisible attacker disappears in a gust of wind. Serah then reveals some of her backstory in Candlekeep to the rest of the party, and Darion talks about the nature of the creature as being summoned by a caster in order to perform a single task.

The session ends with the party considering taking another short rest before meeting the dragon...
