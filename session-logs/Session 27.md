The party decide to take Lady Fidatov up on her offer with the hope of finding a solution in the morning. They head out of her office and meet an Elvish looking fighter named Hawk, who has apparently saved the life of one of the nobles coming to the party. Shortly thereafter, a duergar monk called Allian comes out of the kitchen with a half-made sandwich and a bottle of wine, for which he pays some money to Lady Fidatov. The monk and the fighter join the party.

After some time, the sound of glass breaking can be heard, and starting from Lady Fidatov, all the guests start acting sick, coughing blood and falling dead to the floor. A scream of a woman is heard and suddenly the house's decor transitions into something out of the horror movie, with everything as if having been in ruins for many years, and many bloated, rotten corpses lying around.

The party goes to investigate Lady Fidatov's body, and they see her ghost leaving her corpse, saying somethin about being with her family, and heading outside of the house into the garden, carrying a distortion of reality effect along with her.

The adventurers then explore the house thoroughly, finding a secret room in the walk-in closet of Lady Fidatov's bedroom. There, they find the corpse of Taltos, with a note and a skeleton key. 

They use the skeleton key to make their way to Lady Fidatov's locked office, where they find a document talking about the family crypt and how 2 crests are needed to be put into 2 fountains to get access to the crypt. The adventurers then unlock the art gallery, and find a plague with the missing crest they needed. 
They see the missing crests in the mirror, and Allain tries to knock the mirror but his hands goes through, so he decides to go inside and see if he can get the crest. This, however, this triggers the mirrors' magical defense mechanism, and reflections of the adventurer start materializing, which the party must defeat one by one, until they figure out that it's the mirrors causing the summons and figure out a way to destroy them, putting an end to the threat, and securing the crests for the party. 
They then head to the family crypt, which is surrounded by a hedge maze which seems to have a magical defense mechanism that prevents access through normal means. They start looking for the fountains inside the maze, but get stopped in their tracks by terrifying howl from a creature that gets ever closer. All except Allain stay in place, while he goes invisible and starts looking for the fountains on his own. Eventually, a fearsome hell hound makes its way around the corner and attacks the party. Serah manages to dodge out of the way of its attack with warding flares and pure dodging. Meanwhile, Allan has found a fountain and put a crest in a crevice inside it. Then, he comes back to the start of the maze, where he ends up at the back of the hell hound. He throws the crest over the monstrosity at Hawk, bidding him to find the other fountain.
While Hawk does that, Serah and Allain keep the hound busy. The hound, however, finally manages to land two attacks on Allain, which renders him unconscious, but by this time Hawk has found the fountain and put the crest inside, which unlocks the way to the crypt inside. Somehow, the party manages to make it in, including the downed monk, and make their way in, while the hound seems to not be able to make it inside. 

Then, they head inside the crypt within the maze, heading down into the darkness, where they see a pile of treasure. There, Serah starts praying and Lady Fidatov's ghost appears and emits a frightful wail as she berates them for disturbing her family.
