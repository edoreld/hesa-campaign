## Events

The party makes their way into the village of Barovia, where a raven leads them to the Blood on the Vine tavern in the town square. There, they make the acquaintance of Ismark KolÂ­yanovich, who invites them to drinks and engages them in conversation.

He tells them of Count Strahd's relentless attacks on his family's house. The vampire seems to be obsessed with Ireena - Ismark's sister -, and has bitten her twice. The players agree with Ismark's request that they escort Ireena to the fortified town of Vallaki, where he thinks she will be safer.

On the way to Ismark's house, they hear the sound of a woman crying and are pulled by Lancelot into a house where they meet Mary. Mary's daughter Gertruda disappeared one week ago and hasn't been seen since. The players investigate a bit and leave for Ismark's house.

The players then head to Ismark's house. There, they meet Ireena and they see the coffin of the siblings' father, Kolyan Indirovich - their father - who died of a heart attack during the attacks by Strahd's minions. Ireena agrees to be escorted, but wants the players to help them take her father to the cemetery to be buried.

The adventurers go to church to find the priest - Father Donovich - that can conduct the burial rites, but he says he can't without his holy symbol. To get his holy symbol back, they must go into the basement and take it from Doru, Donavich's son that got turned into a vampire spawn by Strahd.

The adventurers go down into the basement with a plan to kill Doru. Instead, Doru asks them to test him to see if he can control his bloodlust. They tempt him with some blood, and despite Skarr's suspicions, Doru is able to control himself.

There's a somewhat emotional reunion between Doru and Donavich as Donavich realizes his son might still be there. Then, they all head to the cemetery (sans Doru who is staying in the basement), and Donavich conducts the burying ceremony. 

After the ceremony, Strahd makes an appearance and commands Ireena to come to him, which she starts doing as Ismark tries to drag her back. A fight ensues between the adventurers and Strahd's minions, where they try to prevent Ireena to get to Strahd as they fight direwolves, zombies and bats. They finally succeed, with Strahd leaving the battlefield, but Ismark has been mortally wounded. 

Without any concern for her own wealth, Serah uses the three diamonds from the dragon cultists to cast revivify on Ismark, who comes back with immense gratitude. Then, the adventurers witness as hundreds of ghosts of adventurers raise from the graves in the cemetery head to Castle Ravenloft - where the Count lives - as if trying to defeat him as they tried to and failed to in life.

Back at Ismark's house, he offers them a map of the land as thanks for their help so far. Then, the adventurers go to bed and have a shared dream. In the dream, they see a crone that offers to read their fortunes and asks them to come see her at Tser Pool. 

Next morning, they do some overpriced shopping where they hear some stories about Ismark. Then, they leave the village of Barovia on their way to Vallaki. On the way, they stop at the encampment in Tser Pool where they meet the crone from their dream - Madam Eva. She gives them a series of vague fortunes. 

Afterwards, they continue westwards, meeting a man living in the woods and fighting some gargoyles on a bridge. After that, they continue their journey...
