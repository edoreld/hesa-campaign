Year: 1491 DR

Answering the call of your dwarven friend and/or patron **Gundren Rockseeker**, you all gather at the inn of the quacking duck, where a duck steals one of Darion's playing cards. Also, Gungren tells you about a new expedition he's running and how he has need of your particular talents. He wants you to escort some supplies to the town of **Phalandrin**.

You ride a caravan with two oxen and head off into the road with Gundren and eventually meet **Sildar Hallwinter**, a human fighter-looking middled-aged man. After Sildar and Gundren briefly converse, they decide to split from the party so as to reach Phalandrin faster on their horses, and so they go. 

After an hour or so, you enter a clearing with the horses of Gundren and Sildar in a bloody puddle. Before you can do anything, you are waylaid by goblins and you must defend yourselves. A bloody battle ensues in which Skarr is almost felled, and one ox definiteily is, but you emerge victorious, though bloody. 

One of the goblins is alive, and you bind him before he can make his escape. Darion decides to perform a card trick for the goblin, and he does it so masterfully that the goblin becomes convinced that Darion has mighty wizard powers, and cowers before him. The party has then no problem extracting information from the creature. The party learns a bunch of important information, such as the location of the goblin hideout.

After much deliberation, and with a dead ox, the party decides to make their way to the hideout. They discover a cave, the entrance at the foot of a good-sized hill, and a stream going in through it. There, Dax turns into a giant badger and scouts the area. Then, the party tries to make their way to the cave but are found out by two watchmen goblin who happened to be stone skipping. The goblin try to go back into the cave but are felled quickly by the party. 

Seraphalia picks up the stone they were stone skipping with and notices how perfect it is shaped for skipping. Then she to throw the stone on the stream, but fails miserably. The stone, however, being of perfect shape for skipping, still manages a few bounces. Then, everyone sees Seraphalia take out the exact same stone from her pocket. She keeps it. 

Having scouted the cave, Dax knows there's a hidden goblin scout on a bridge watching for intruders. Seraphalia enters stealthily and puts him to sleep with magic before he can do anything. Then, Skarr heroically climbs up the walls of the cave to reach the bridge and throws the sleeping goblin to dax. The party binds and gags the goblin and leaves him outside the cave. 

They go back in and meet a family of tied wolves in a small chamber. The wolves snarl at the party as Skarr approaches with peaceful intentions and then throws the bound goblin to them. The wolves's aggressivity seems to die down as the accept this gift of meat and devour the gnome. 

Then Serah climbs up 30-feet up the natural chimney in the east side of the room and scouts the area, finding a hobgoblin accompanied by a wolf and some goblins henchmen. She goes back down and after some deliberation the party decides to lure the boss down, so Seraphalia, lacking any formal training on acting, decides that the best way to do so is speaking in (terrible) goblin accent and without changing her voice at all. Needless to say, the ruse does not suceed. 

Those of the party that understand goblin hear an imposing voice cry out "There are humans in the cave!". Then, fearing the goblins coming around to meet the party, the adventurers all go up the chimney, with Dax freeing up the wolves as a last action before turning into a spider and climbing up himself. The room Serah had previously scouted is now empty, and the party starts talking among themselves, but after a few minutes of this, a goblin appears round a corner...
