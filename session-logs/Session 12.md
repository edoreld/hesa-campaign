# Events

Getting late after the bridge encounter, and starting to snow, the party looks for a safe place to take a rest. They find a cave and enter it, hearing a haunting melody that leads them to a giant iron golem playing a flute. 

The golem introduces himself as Grommash and tells them about his mission to end his own existence, and asks them to retrieve a crystal from the depths of the cave in order to do so. He offers some items that might be of interest to the party in exchange.

The party then head inside the cave. First, they encounter a tentacle monster that roughens them up a bit. Then, they solve a riddle given by a stone head.

Further in, they find a flesh golem brooming the cave, which they pass around, and then find a treant whispering dark words to himself. They talk to the treant a bit and he lets them pass further into the cave.

As the reach the darkest recesses of the cave, they find a giant snail. As they approach it, he goes into defensive mode and a battle ensues in which fight some ooze and the snail that's reflecting their spells.

Then, they find the black crystal and go back to the golem. On the way back, they talk to the flesh golem, who says his name is Jim. The Jim says he needs to go clean up the mess the adventurers made.
