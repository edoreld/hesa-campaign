Featuring
Quinn playing as the cleric, Serah Heyman 
Jon, playing as Harromir Dunzch

Serah and company travels to Yester Hill, and meets an elf sorcerer who falls from a portal. He seems trustworthy and they decide to travel together. 

The adventurers go up Yester Hill, dealing with some patrols on the way. At the top, they get stopped by a wild looking guy. Meanwhile, some other folks are conducting some sort of chanting around a big statue in the back. A fight ensues as the wild looking guy tries to stop them from getting close to the statue. A triple KO from a lightning strike scares the shit out of the adventurers, but Skarr is able to get Serah back up, and she spreads some healing around. 

Too much time passes, and the ritual is complete, with a big ass tree coming out of the statue. The adventurers watch the tree headed for the winery, and the new sorcerer guy throws a fireball at it to stop it on its tracks. More fighting, and thanks to Skarr's fine plant hating axe, they take it down fairly quickly. Then, they take a look around, and find a funny looking tree with a skeleton at the base holding a magical looking axe. When they get close, a billion blights attack them, but Serah's celestial radiance is too much for them. The end up looting the magical axe, consider burning the tree but decide not to in the end.

Back in the winery, they get thanked a lot. Then, they head to Krezk with some sweet wine and gain entry into the city. There, they briefly meet the Burgomaster and hear of the Abbot's resurrecting magic. They head to the abbot, meeting some ugly-ass creatures along the way, and talk to him about Stella's condition. He doesn't seem to be able to help, and suggests finding a cleric of greater power than him
The adventurers decide to then spend some time exploring the Abbot's Abbey, and come across a woman wearing Vistani clothing who Serah seems to recognize from her fortune telling. Then, Serah decides to use one of the charms she got from a previous adventure to cast greater restoration on Stella, who stops believing she's a "little kitty" and has her sanity restored.
