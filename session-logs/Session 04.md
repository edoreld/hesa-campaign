## Events

 - Year: 1491 DR

With clever strategy, the party draws out the orcs in small groups and defeat them. They loot the cave and then head back to town, where they see the aftermath of what appears to have been a redbrand raid, with some homes vandalised and the herbalist now missing. They head to the townmaster hall where they collect the reward for the orc mission, and they meet Sildar who entrusts them with a mission to find out information about his associate Iarno Albrek, which was last seen around Tresendar Manor. 

They head to Tresendar manor and find a ladder going down. They head down and find a room with some barrels. Skarr investigates, but makes too much noise moving barrels around. Some bandits in the adjoining room notice and stealthly surprise the party. A battle ensues and the party defeats them. Skarr takes a victorious bath and finds a bag with some nice loot in it
